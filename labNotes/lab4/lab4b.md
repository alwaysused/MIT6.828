# Lab4 Part B - Copy-on-Write Fork



Naive `fork` copies the entire address space, which is inefficient. Later versions of Unix used virtual memory hardware to allow the parent and child to *share* the memory mapped into their own address spaces until one of the processes modifies it. This technique is known as *copy-on-write*. To do this, on `fork()` the kernel would copy the address space *mappings* from the parent to the child instead of the contents of the mapped pages, and mark the now-shared pages read-only. When one of the two processes tries to write to one of these shared pages, the process takes a page fault. At this point, the Unix kernel realizes that the page was really a "virtual" or "copy-on-write" copy, and so it makes a new, private, writable copy of the page for the faulting process. In this way, the contents of individual pages aren't actually copied until they are actually written to. This optimization makes a `fork()` followed by an `exec()` in the child much cheaper: the child will probably only need to copy one page (the current page of its stack) before it calls `exec()`.

We'll implement `fork()` with copy-on-write support in user-space, leaving the kernel simple and allowing for flexibility. 

## User-level page fault handling

Copy-on-write is only one of many possible uses for user-level page fault handling.

It's common to set up an address space so that page faults indicate when some action needs to take place. For example, most Unix kernels initially map only a single page for a new process's stack, and allocate and map additional stack pages "on demand" as the process's stack grows. The kernel must keep track of what action to take when a page fault occurs in each region of the address space. For example, a fault in the stack region will allocate and map new page of physical memory. A fault in the BSS region will typically allocate a new page, fill it with zeroes, and map it. In systems with demand-paged executables, a fault in the text region will read a page of the binary off of disk and then map it.

To acheive the feature above, the kernel needs to keep track of a lot of information. For JOS, action for page fault would be decided in the user space. 

### Setting the Page Fault Handler

The user environment registers a *page fault handler entrypoint* with the JOS kernel using `sys_env_set_pgfault_upcall`. 

> **Exercise 8.** Implement the `sys_env_set_pgfault_upcall` system call. Be sure to enable permission checking when looking up the environment ID of the target environment, since this is a "dangerous" system call.

+       return 0;
 }
```

### Normal and Exception Stacks in User Environments

At normal execution, the user environment runs on the *normal* user stack, in region `[USTACKTOP-PGSIZE, USTACKTOP]`. When page fault occurs, the kernel would make the user environment run the designated page fault handler on the *user exception stack*. In essence, we will implement automatic "stack switching" for the user environment, in a similar way that the x86 *processor* already implements stack switching when transferring from user mode to kernel mode! Recall the processor uses information in TSS to do this stack switching.

Each user environment that wants to support user-level page fault handling needs to allocate memory for its own exception stack, using the `sys_page_alloc()` system call in part A.

### Invoking the User Page Fault Handler

We call the state of the user environment at the time of the user-mode page fault the *trap-time* state.

If there is no page fault handler registered, the JOS kernel destroys the user environment. Otherwise, the kernel sets up a trap frame, `struct UTrapframe`, on the exception stack.

```
					<-- UXSTACKTOP
trap-time esp
trap-time eflags
trap-time eip
trap-time eax       start of struct PushRegs
trap-time ecx
trap-time edx
trap-time ebx
trap-time esp
trap-time ebp
trap-time esi
trap-time edi       end of struct PushRegs
tf_err (error code)
fault_va            <-- %esp when handler is run	
```

The kernel arranges for the user environment to resume running the page fault handler on the exception stack with this stack frame. The `fault_va` is the virtual address that caused the page fault..

If the user environment is *already* running on the user exception stack when an exception occurs, then the page fault handler itself has faulted. You should start the new stack frame under the current `tf->tf_esp` rather than at `UXSTACKTOP`. First push an empty 32-bit word, then a `struct UTrapframe`.

> **Exercise 9.** Implement the code in `page_fault_handler` in `kern/trap.c` required to dispatch page faults to the user-mode handler. Be sure to take appropriate precautions when writing into the exception stack. (What happens if the user environment runs out of space on the exception stack?)

### User-mode Page Fault Entrypoint

> **Exercise 10.** Implement the `_pgfault_upcall` routine in `lib/pfentry.S`. The interesting part is returning to the original point in the user code that caused the page fault. You'll return directly there, without going back through the kernel. The hard part is simultaneously switching stacks and re-loading the EIP.

> **Exercise 11.** Finish `set_pgfault_handler()` in `lib/pgfault.c`.

`pgfault_upall` is interesting. The manipulation of trapframe is similar to HW5.

Not too many lines of code. But it took me a bit long to get it right. Points worthy of notice:

1. Use UVPT to access the page directory and page tables. For detail, refers to `uvpt.md`. Remember to ensure that the page table exists before accessing PTE.
2. When inputting address as argument to functions, make sure you're using the right address.
   - In `pgfault`, when doing `memcpy` and `sys_page_map`, you should use `remap_va`, instead of `addr`. 
   - In `fork`, allocate exception stack at `(UXSTACKTOP - PGSIZE)`, instead of `UXSTACKTOP`. 
3. In `duppage`, when mapping COW pages, remember to map them as NOT writtable. 
4. Fixed the bug in Lab3 in `trap.c:page_fault_handler`. More precise check using `user_mem_assert`. 
5. The return value of `sys_exofork` is different in child and parent.

**Question**: Why we need to mark pages in both child process and parent process as COW? What if we did not mark the pages in the parent process as COW?

Answer: If pages are not marked as COW in the parent process, and the child doesn't write to that page. Then the parent process could write to its page and the changes would be seen by the child process. However, `fork` wants the chlid process to have separate address space.

**Question**: In `duppage`, we map the page copy-on-write into the address space of the child and then *remap* the page copy-on-write in its own address space. Why must we do it in this order?

Answer: Suppose we first mark pages in parent as COW. Before we mark pages in child as COW, the parent process writes to the page (image this page is the user stack) and thus a new page would be allocated, and this would be mapped to the child process and marked as COW. Up to now, everything is good. But consider the previous question: suppose later the parent process writes to the new page again, this change would be experienced by the child process! Again, the child doesn't have a separate address space.
